             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Interior design magazines often show retro style as an interior
                  decoration of mixed styles and objects from the past, second hand and new. For example,
                   1970s patterned wallpapers, combined with second-hand furniture also from the 1970s, 
                   the 1960s or 1950s. The value of old artifacts has increased, because the objects used 
                   to be considered old-fashioned and every day. In this case ‘retro’ indicates a value,
                    which is also partly why today's retailers produce new objects in an old style.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Retrotronics (a portmanteau of "retro" and "electronics", 
                also retro-tronics) is the making of electric circuits or appliances using older electric
                 components, such as vacuum tubes, Nixie displays, relays, uniselectors, analogue meters, etc.
                  These are usually chosen more for their aesthetic qualities than performance.
                Retrotronics is a popular strand within the steampunk movement. At the Oxford exhibition 
                of Steampunk art, a third of the works on show had a strong retrotronic influence, from 
                light fittings of period components through to computer keyboards and webcams of burnished 
                copper and brass. Outside steampunk, similar influences are found amongst the retro-futurist scene.
                 Other sources cite the Maker movement as an influence.
                A recent musical trend has sought to recapture early 1980s 8-bit game and synthesiser sounds,
                 often referred to as chiptune. Artists such as Kid Carpet perform entire sets on children's 
                 toys or pocket synths of the period. Other artists, such as Nullsleep, perform using only period
                  video game hardware. DJs offer dance music events built from samples of period games or gadgets.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Pc cards of 1990s</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">All PC Card devices use a similar sized package which is 85.6 millimetres
                 (3.37 in) long and 54.0 millimetres (2.13 in) wide, the same size as a credit card. The shape is also 
                 used by the Common Interface form of conditional-access modules for DVB broadcasts, and by Panasonic for
                  their professional "P2" video acquisition memory cards. The original standard was defined for both
                  5 V and 3.3 volt cards, with 3.3 V cards having a key on the side to prevent them from being inserted
                   fully into a 5 V-only slot. Some cards and some slots operate at both voltages as needed. The original 
                   standard was built around an 'enhanced' 16-bit ISA bus platform. A newer version of the PCMCIA standard 
                   is CardBus (see below), a 32-bit version of the original standard. In addition to supporting a wider bus
                    of 32 bits (instead of the original 16), CardBus also supports bus mastering and operation speeds up to 33 MHz.</p>
